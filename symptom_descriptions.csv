-Answer
Your account for the Proqure service (“Proqure Wallet”) is linked to any account that you have established for purchasing products or services through a website or an application operated by Proqure or a Proqure affiliate (“Proqure marketplace account”).
To create a new Proqure Wallet you must either register using log in details for your existing Proqure marketplace account, or create new login details on our website or application (which you will be directed to from the checkout page of any merchants who accept payment via the Proqure service). If you do not have an existing Proqure marketplace account at the time you register for the Proqure service, you can later use the same credentials to connect and create a linked Proqure marketplace account.
You agree to keep the password for your Proqure Wallet or other authentication method (“password”) confidential and notify us in writing immediately as provided at section 24 if you become aware of any disclosure of your password in order that we may block your account.
Your Proqure Wallet shall be used exclusively by you and you agree to be responsible for any activity on your Proqure Wallet or your Proqure marketplace account arising out of any failure to keep your password confidential, and that you may be held liable for any losses arising out of such a failure.
We may suspend or cancel your account, and/or edit your account details, at any time in our sole discretion and without notice or explanation.
Proqure Wallets are intended for use by individuals. You may not register for a Proqure Wallet if you are under 18 years of age. By using the Proqure service and agreeing to these terms and conditions, you warrant and represent to us that you are an individual of at least 18 years of age.
