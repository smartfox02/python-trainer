1.Introduction
1.Proqure Retail Networks Ltd. (“Proqure” or “we” or “us”) provides a payment service (“Proqure service”) to enable the buyer (“buyer” or “you”) to make payments for products or services purchased on websites and applications operated by Proqure, its affiliated companies, and other third party merchants who accept payment via the Proqure service (“merchants”).
2.These terms and conditions apply to your use of the Proqure service whether you make payments or access the service using a website or an application operated by a third party merchant; or by a merchant that is owned or controlled by us, in control of us, or under common control with us (“a Proqure affiliate”).
3.By using the Proqure service, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions and our policies, each as may be modified from time to time. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you may not access or use the Proqure service.
2.Registration
1.Your account for the Proqure service (“Proqure Wallet”) is linked to any account that you have established for purchasing products or services through a website or an application operated by Proqure or a Proqure affiliate (“Proqure marketplace account”).
2.To create a new Proqure Wallet you must either register using log in details for your existing Proqure marketplace account, or create new login details on our website or application (which you will be directed to from the checkout page of any merchants who accept payment via the Proqure service). If you do not have an existing Proqure marketplace account at the time you register for the Proqure service, you can later use the same credentials to connect and create a linked Proqure marketplace account.
3.You agree to keep the password for your Proqure Wallet or other authentication method (“password”) confidential and notify us in writing immediately as provided at section 24 if you become aware of any disclosure of your password in order that we may block your account.
4.Your Proqure Wallet shall be used exclusively by you and you agree to be responsible for any activity on your Proqure Wallet or your Proqure marketplace account arising out of any failure to keep your password confidential, and that you may be held liable for any losses arising out of such a failure.
5.We may suspend or cancel your account, and/or edit your account details, at any time in our sole discretion and without notice or explanation.
6.Proqure Wallets are intended for use by individuals. You may not register for a Proqure Wallet if you are under 18 years of age. By using the Proqure service and agreeing to these terms and conditions, you warrant and represent to us that you are an individual of at least 18 years of age.
3.Your account
1.Your Proqure Wallet permits you to access the information in your Proqure Wallet to make purchases to merchants who accept Proqure.
2.You may register and access in your Proqure Wallet one or more credit cards, debit cards, and other payment methods that we accept for making purchases (“payment methods”).
3.Any payment method you use with Proqure will automatically be saved to your Proqure Wallet. A list of your saved payment methods will appear on the payments page.
4.You may access your payment methods in Proqure for making purchases. You may be required to verify that you control the payment methods in your Proqure Wallet prior to using them for making any purchases.
5.You agree to provide any information that we or our financial institutions may require or that you may be required by law to provide, in respect of the Proqure service.
4.Our role
1.Our Proqure service enables buyers to use the payment information stored in the Proqure Wallet to make payments to merchants.
2.The availability of payment methods may vary depending on the merchant. Some features may also be limited based on where you are located and what we know about you.
3.Proqure acts as the service provider of the merchant in connection with the Proqure service, except in cases where another payment service provider enables a merchant to accept the Proqure service.
4.We may use the services of one or more third parties, affiliates, processors, and/or financial institutions to provide the Proqure service.
5.Your payment service provider is the entity that issued your payment method e.g. credit card, debit card or mobile money provider.
6.Except for our limited role in enabling the merchant to accept the Proqure service, we are not involved in any underlying sales transaction between you and the merchant. In particular:
1.we are neither the buyer nor the seller of the items or services the merchant offers for sale and are not a party to the sales contract;
2.the merchant is the seller of record for all sales via the Proqure service. The name of Proqure, one of our affiliates, or the merchant’s payment service provider, will appear on the statement issued by your payment service provider (which may also, at our option, display the merchant’s trade or business name).
7.A buyer’s obligation to pay for an item purchased via the Proqure service is satisfied when the buyer properly pays in full for that item via the Proqure service. We are not a fiduciary or trustee of either the buyer or the merchant.
8.Subject to section 8 below, we will not mediate disputes between buyers and merchants or enforce or execute the performance of any sales contract.
5.Payments
1.Buyers may pay for products and services sold by any person with a merchant account.
2.All transactions shall be denominated in the currency stated on the Proqure payments page. If your payment service provider does not recognise fractions of the currency sub-unit, we may round up the transaction value to the nearest sub-unit.
3.You may be charged a cash advance, currency exchange (if applicable) or other fees directly by your payment service provider. We are not responsible for these fees.
4.In the event that you receive a refund in respect of products purchased using Proqure, we may apply the refund to your Proqure Wallet, unless not permitted by applicable law.
6.Cashback and promotions
1.We may issue you with cashback in respect of specified purchases. Cashback may be used within the period specified in the terms and conditions of the promotion or, if no period is specified, within three (3) months of the end of the promotion, upon which it shall expire.
2.We may issue vouchers or gift cards pursuant to a promotional activity. Vouchers or gift cards may be used within the period specified in the terms and conditions of the promotion or, if no period is specified, within seven (7) days of the end of the promotion, upon which it shall expire.
3.We reserve the right to cancel or promotions or cashback if we suspect fraud or foul play; or if you close your Proqure Wallet.
7.Record keeping
1.When an order is confirmed from your Proqure Wallet, we will update your account page and provide you a transaction confirmation email. The confirmation email will serve as your receipt. You may receive a separate receipt from the merchant for the transaction.
2.Summaries of your Proqure Wallet activity, including the list of transactions, are available on your account page.
3.Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Proqure Wallet and your use of the Proqure service, and (b) reconciling all payment activity and all other transactional information that is associated with your Proqure Wallet.

2.for the purpose of disclosures pursuant to a valid order by a court or other governmental body; or
3.as otherwise required by law or applicable regulation.
3.You agree to cooperate with us, including by providing witness statements to the police or other law enforcement agencies, in order to investigate any frauds or disputed transactions relating to your account.


10.Buyer disputes
1.If you are unsatisfied with any products or services that you have purchased using our Proqure service, you should contact the merchant directly first.
2.If you are unable to resolve the matter with the merchant, you may file a complaint against the merchant by contacting us as provided at section 24.
3.If you dispute any transaction with Proqure, you should first contact us as provided at section 24, and if we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your payment service provider later. If Proqure does not make a final decision on your claim until after your payment service provider’s deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from your payment service provider, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the merchant or your payment service provider).
4.If a dispute arises between you (as a buyer) and a merchant, you release us (and our agents and employees) from any and all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) in any way connected with the dispute and the transaction.
